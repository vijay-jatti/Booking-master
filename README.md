# Booking-master
hotel booking app
# Task
Your task is to implement a simple hotel booking manager in Java, as a microservice API. The
number of rooms should be configurable, and it should expose the following methods:

1.A method to store a booking. A booking consists of a guest name, a room number, and a
date.

2.A method to find the available rooms on a given date.  

3.A method to find all the bookings for a given guest. 


# Guidance
1.Use only in-memory data structures; do not use a database.  

2.Do not use any framework or libraries in your solution.  

3.Provide tests with your solution (you may use libraries for the tests).  

4.Your solution should build with Maven or Gradle.  

5.Do not need to take into account the booking cancellation and guest check out.  

6.Test cases as comprehensive as possible.

7.Please share github link of your solution with us.
